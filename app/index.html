        					<p>
								I've worked as a Content Editor Manager for several years at Franklin University. I’ve edited and
								implemented hundreds of online courses, working as a team of instructional designers and subject
								matter experts. I’ve managed a team of five editors, as well as publication deadlines and design
								schedules. I’ve developed numerous Articulate Storyline training pieces for courses and for clients, and
								have designed and developed print programs and materials for University conferences.
							</p><p>
								Outside of Franklin University, I’ve edited novels, dissertations, and scholarly journal articles, all of which
								have made it to publication. I love using words to convey thoughts and ideas, and for these words to
								effectively communication with the intended audience.
							</p><p>
								For fun, I love reading young adult dystopian fiction, spending time with my family, and exploring
								Columbus.

								<p>Carolyn maintains a highly positive attitude in all aspects of her work with others that is contagious. In
								the face of deadlines that are aggressive and tasks that are daunting, you can count on Carolyn to exude
								a “can do” approach to projects. This results in maintaining courses that reflect excellence in design and
								delivery.</p>

								<p>Carolyn… is clearly up to date with technology that is used in education. Any time that I needed
								assistance or an explanation, she was always quick to respond. If she didn’t know the answer, should
								would find it for me. When she put the story boards together for the videos, she… had the ability to
								understand the topics I was going to discuss each week (even though mathematics is not her field of
								study) and to find graphics that matched the lessons. I was thoroughly impressed with her work, her
								enthusiasm and the love she has for her job.</p>

								<p>I’ve worked with Carolyn for the last year and a half. During this time she has been an excellent
									colleague and such a pleasure to work with.
									In the efforts of building multimedia lectures for Math 215 as part of the big redesign, she was there at
									every step of the way, from planning to executing and then to finalizing. Carolyn was included in a team
									of content editors and faculty to develop these interactive multimedia lectures and she presented
									excellence at every step of the way. Together we developed 28 multimedia lectures and in most of them
									you can hear Carolyn’s lovely voice as the audio. She made sure the audio and the animation on the
									screen were synchronizing and the flow and the tone of the lecture was not boring or intimidating for
									students. Sometimes, she had to work on a single multimedia lecture several days just to make sure that
									it is at the level of excellency she seek for.
									Even though she is not in a faculty position hence not required to be involved in scholarly research, she
									was more than happy to be a part of our math 215 multimedia research project and also of reporting
									the results research. She made sure all the instructions for the students were clear and easy to follow
									and she never hesitated to take the extra mile to make all the course content consistent and
									understandable. She created wonderful visual ppt slides and posters to present our work together.
									She has always been kind, easy to work with and a positive influence to others. She never complains
									about the work to be done or the problems occurring along the way. She is an excellent problem
									solver.</p>

								<p>…As I became better acquainted with Carolyn after she was hired, I appreciated not only her
								outstanding skills and work ethic as a content editor and colleague, but also her spirit of calmness, joy,
								and her desire for excellence in every task, every day. I often came to Carolyn with what must have
								surely been miniscule problems that were nevertheless important to me. Carolyn always greeted me
								with a smile that was genuinely friendly, and that also let me know she was confident and capable of
								performing the work needed. Carolyn was never flustered, and she never considered any job to be too
								small or inconsequential; she always treated my problems as her problems, and my important issues
								became important to her. She never completed a job without a quality check and a customer check. She
								always made sure that the work was right, and would never quit until she was sure that I was satisfied
								with the final product. In all respects—quality of work, taking care of her customers—Carolyn is truly
								excellent—in fact, Carolyn is outstanding! I have always enjoyed working with Carolyn. I appreciate all of
								the work she has performed for me, her attention to producing the best possible quality outcomes, and
								her positive outlook in all she does.</p>
								<h4>Dr. Charles Saunders</h4>

								<p>Carolyn gets things done well, on time, with precision for quality, and often asks what else she can help
								with…. (she is) cheerful, positive, and is a good, caring listener. She also shares good ideas and
								significantly contributes to the realization of those ideas in her work. This inspires excellence in those
								around her.</p>

								<p>When Rob and I worked on the international training project, Carolyn helped us with a PPT background
									customization. She spent some hours after the regular office hours in order for us to complete the
									project on time. A great example of providing dedicated services to students, colleagues, and
									community.</p>
								<h4>Dr. Hong Wang</h4>

							<div class="testi_item">
								<p>Carolyn’s work ethic reflects an exemplary example of how a Content Editor exhibits leadership that
									results in a high level of engagement with faculty and staff. Even when deadlines are quickly
									approaching or unexpected Carolyn will typically say “do not worry – we will be sure the changes or
									project is done”. Her positive attitude is maintained even under high pressure that demonstrates her
									commitment to Franklin and production of materials that exemplify a commitment to excellence in work
									for our students.</p>

								<p>I believe you are making an excellent choice in your nomination of Carolyn. I have always enjoyed

								<p>Carolyn excels at finding ways to make improvements and work together with the department, often
								going above and beyond her primary job description. She manages her time so that she not only
								diligently completes all her required duties, but also volunteers to contribute to the betterment of other
								projects. She recently took on the task of redesigning the Teaching & Learning in Higher Education
								Conference Program and I was thrilled by her incredible impact and her dedication to quality. She
								coordinated with other team members and put in the difficult and time-consuming work of considering
								every small detail—the fonts, the color scheme, the structure and progression of information, the
								themes and branding—to ensure a great user experience.  Her refusal to make something only ‘good
								enough’ is clear in that design and in everything else she does.</p>

								<p>In addition to being one of the sweetest, most optimistic people I’ve known, Carolyn gives the
								impression that she can, and will, do anything that’s asked of her, and with a smile on her face. She
								treats every task/project/request as if it’s the most important thing on her plate at that moment, and
								she will give it her best effort every time. She always follows through and produces above average
								results... Her work ethic is genuinely stellar, and she doesn’t hesitate to contribute good ideas and
								suggestions to group efforts.</p>
